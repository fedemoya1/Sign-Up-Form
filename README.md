# This is my third challenge from FrontendMentor.io

- In this project  I used only HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
- I took this challenge just to show my skills. It might has some errors but Im still learning and I will improve.
- This is a form that throws an error if any input is empty. It is responsive made mobile first. 
- You can visualize this page at: "https://formulario-fede.netlify.app/"
